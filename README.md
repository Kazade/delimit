# Delimit Text Editor

Delimit is a text editor that I'm building for *my* usage pattern. It won't support a plugin infrastructure, or try to do everything - just the things I care about.

##TODO

 - Make split view work
 - Implement a code completion framework, initially targetting Python
 - Implement basic VCS integration, initially targetting GIT (show current branch, show add/deletes in gutter, blame)
 - Implement a checker framework, initially using pyflakes

## Submitting patches

Because I'm still not convinced LGPL is the right license for this, if you submit patches please submit them under the MIT license. Thanks!
